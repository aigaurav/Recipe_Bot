            "**Poha** is a popular Maharashtrian breakfast dish made from flattened rice, known for its light yet flavorful profile. It is quick to prepare and loved for its simplicity and taste. Below is a detailed recipe for making Poha.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Ingredients\n",
            "\n",
            "- 2 cups thick poha (flattened rice)\n",
            "- 1 medium onion, finely chopped\n",
            "- 1-2 green chilies, finely chopped\n",
            "- 1/4 cup peanuts\n",
            "- 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds\n",
            "- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
            "- 1 tablespoon oil\n",
            "- Salt to taste\n",
            "- 8-10 curry leaves\n",
            "- 1 small potato, peeled and diced (optional)\n",
            "- 1 tablespoon sugar (optional, for a slight sweetness)\n",
            "- Juice of 1/2 a lemon\n",
            "- Fresh coriander leaves, chopped, for garnish\n",
            "- Grated coconut (optional), for garnish\n",
            "- Sev (optional), for garnish\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Instructions\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Rinse Poha:**\n",
            "   - Place the poha in a colander and rinse it under running water. Ensure it is softened but not mushy. Let it sit in the colander to drain any excess water.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Preparation:**\n",
            "   - In a small bowl, mix the rinsed poha with salt, sugar, and turmeric powder. Set aside.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Cooking:**\n",
            "   - Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the peanuts and fry them until golden brown. Remove and set aside.\n",
            "   - In the same pan, add mustard seeds. Once they start to crackle, add curry leaves and green chilies. Saut√© for a few seconds.\n",
            "   - Add chopped onions and saut√© until translucent. If using potatoes, add them now and cook until they are tender.\n",
            "   - Add the prepared poha to the pan and mix gently. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, ensuring the poha is heated through and well-coated with the turmeric and onion mixture.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Finish:**\n",
            "   - Add the fried peanuts back to the poha. Stir gently.\n",
            "   - Turn off the heat and squeeze lemon juice over the poha. Mix well.\n",
            "   - Garnish with chopped coriander leaves, grated coconut, and sev if using.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Serving Suggestions\n",
            "\n",
            "- Serve poha hot, garnished with additional sev and coconut if desired.\n",
            "- It pairs well with a hot cup of chai or coffee for a complete breakfast experience.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Cultural Significance\n",
            "\n",
            "Poha is a staple breakfast dish in Maharashtra and other parts of Western India.

The dish has regional variations, with some versions including ingredients like green peas or grated carrots, highlighting its versatility.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### Nutritional Notes\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Calories and Macronutrients:** Poha is relatively low in calories and provides a good source of carbohydrates, making it an energy-boosting breakfast option.\n",
            "- **Protein and Fiber:** The inclusion of peanuts adds protein and healthy fats, while onions and potatoes contribute fiber.\n",
            "- **Vitamins and Minerals:** Turmeric provides anti-inflammatory benefits, and the dish includes vitamin C from lemon juice and onions.\n",
            "- **Customization:** Poha can be customized with additional vegetables or spices to increase nutritional value and cater to personal taste preferences.\n",
            "\n",
            "Poha is not only a comforting and easy-to-make dish but also offers a glimpse into the heart of Maharashtrian cuisine, showcasing how simplicity can lead to deliciousness.\n",
